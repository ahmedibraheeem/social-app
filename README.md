# SocialApp
## Angular 5 social network app
  start the application by going to the file directory and open the terminal then write 
  ```markdown
  $ ng serve 
```
  then go to your browser and go to http://localhost:4200/
  
  you can either search by name or by ID.
  
  enter the name/ID and press search.

  then you'll see a table of the user's information 
  
  And another table for his friends (those people who are directly connected to the chosen user.)
  
  And another table for Friends of friends (those who are two steps away from the chosen user but not directly connected to the chosen user.)
  
  And another table for the suggested friends (people in the group who know two or more direct friends of the chosen user but are not directly connected to the chosen user.)
  
Note: I created the whole project in one component and didn't need any services or directives because it's a small project which doesn't need any of that.
